# TODO for Creating Medium Templates in myapp

- [x] Update demo/myapp/views.py to use render() instead of HttpResponse, passing context with article-like data (title, author, content)
- [x] Create demo/myapp/templates/index.html with Medium-inspired design: clean layout, typography, sections for title, author, date, content
- [ ] Run Django server (python manage.py runserver) to test the template rendering
- [ ] Verify the page displays correctly in browser
